TRAINING IMPLICATIONS
==================================================
The GAN model training treats each image independently and does not
explicitly track or use face identity information during training.
However, the distribution of faces and number of images per face
will implicitly affect what the model learns.

Faces with more images will have greater influence on the training.
For more balanced training, consider using the --max_per_face option
when processing the dataset.
